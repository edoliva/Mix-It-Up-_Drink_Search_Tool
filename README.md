## Installation
Clone or download this repository on GitHub then open "edoliva.github.io/Mix-It-Up-_Drink_Search_Tool" in a browser.  
## Criteria
- The user must enter the name of a an ingredient to search for a meal or drink. As more ingredients are searched, the names are rendered in the "Your searches" section. The previous 7 searches will be rendered.
- If the user enters an invalid ingredient name then no meals/drinks data will be displayed.
- Previous searches can be re-searched by clicking on their name on the left column.
- The user may clear all previous searches from local storage.
- Within the recipe, the user may click on additional ingredients to search.  
## Usage/coding:
- This HTML, CSS and JS were written to allow for a clean user experience. The general logic is as follows:
   - The left cloumn displays an input that saves the ingredient names to local storage in an array.
   - The API URL is updated to include the most recently entered ingredient. The city name is dynamic and will be the most recent user ingredient entry. 
   - Invalid entries will yield no result.
   - The url will link to an array of objects that represent all the meals in the API which include the searched ingredient.
   - Variables are created that will reference specific items in the array. These items are then rendered by using document.querySelector. 
   - The meal icons are displayed by pulling the "image" code that updates a url and the meal name. API's hosted by www.themealdb.com/api.php and www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php.
   - When a user clicks on their saved searches it acts as though this is a new search, and enters that ingredient name as the most recent ingredient in the local storage array.
   - The user can click on the "Clear search history" button and it will clear the locally saved items. 

- Recipe information:
   - Once the user clicks on a meal or drink recipe name they like, they are presented with a meal/drink picture, a brief description, cooking/mixing instructions, a YouTube video(for the meal), and a list of all the ingredients included in that meal/drink.
   - The listed ingredients clickable buttons and will search that ingredient.
   - As with any other search input, it will present the user with a list if meals that include that ingredient.
   - Rinse, repeat.
